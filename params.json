{"name":"Bootstrap","body":"Bootstrap\r\n=========\r\n\t\r\nVariables and mixins to bootstrap any new web development project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current stable version: 3.0.1\r\n\r\nYou may safely use this one, can be found in _master_ branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current development branch: 4.X.X\r\n\r\nDon't use right now, this may break a lot of stuff (we're switching to _rem_, _em_ is dead now -- and obviously that's a major change). You can find it in _devel_ branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nAll you need is to import _bootstrap_ in your _.less_ file, usually the main one:\r\n\r\n    // bootstrap setup\r\n    @import \"bootstrap/bootstrap.less\";\r\n    @import \"bootstrap/bootstrap-reset.less\";\r\n    @import \"bootstrap/bootstrap-addons.less\";\r\n    @import \"bootstrap/bootstrap-typography.less\";\r\n    @import \"bootstrap/bootstrap-print.less\";\r\n    \r\nThere's no need to include all files. Just use what's useful for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Forking\r\n\r\nFork as needed. I'd like to push back to Mark's original repo, but I think it's not possible anymore. We're just too far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nContact me if you have any questions. You can use GitHub issues too. And if you use this thing, let me know! My ego needs it! :]\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n## Authors:\r\n\r\n* Original: Mark Otto ([http://markdotto.com/bootstrap](http://markdotto.com/bootstrap))\r\n* Fork and addons by Vaclav Vancura / SAY Media ([vvancura@saymedia.com](mailto:vvancura@saymedia.com)) and Alex Schleifer ([alexoid@saymedia.com](mailto:alexoid@saymedia.com))","tagline":"Bootstrap.less is a collection of mixins and variables for LESS that helps you quickly code with CSS.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
