SAY:LESS
========
	
Variables and mixins to bootstrap any new web development project.


### Current stable version: 3.0.3

You may safely use this one, can be found in _master_ branch.


### Current development branch: 4.X.X

Don't use right now, this may break a lot of stuff (we're switching to _rem_, _em_ is dead now -- and obviously that's a major change). You can find it in _devel_ branch.


### How to use

All you need is to import _sayless_ in your _.less_ file, usually the main one:

    // sayless setup
    @import "sayless/sayless.less";
    @import "sayless/sayless-reset.less";
    @import "sayless/sayless-addons.less";
    @import "sayless/sayless-typography.less";
    @import "sayless/sayless-print.less";
    
There's no need to include all files. Just use what's useful for you.


### Forking

Fork as needed. I'd like to push back to Mark's original repo, but I think it's not possible anymore. We're just too far away.


### Contact

Contact me if you have any questions. You can use GitHub issues too. And if you use this thing, let me know! My ego needs it! :]
