### Current stable version: 4.X.X

You may safely use this one, can be found in _master_ branch.



### How to use

This needs to be updated! See the tag 3.X.X for previous documentation.



### Forking

Fork as needed. I'd like to push back to Mark's original repo, but I think it's not possible anymore. We're just too far away.



### Contact

Contact me if you have any questions. You can use GitHub issues too. And if you use this thing, let me know! My ego needs it! :]
